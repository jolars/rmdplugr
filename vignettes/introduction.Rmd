# Motivation

The motivation for **rmdplugr** was first off to produce a cleaner latex output
format for rmarkdown documents, given that the default settings modify
standard latex template by introducing

* wide margins,
* compact titles, and
* paragraph spacing (instead of indentation).

All of these make changes to the, in my opinion, well-founded design choices
and should be alternatives rather than the default. I understand
the stance taken by the pandoc team that output should
be made similar across different outputs, yet I believe that the vast majority
of users---particularly of Rmarkdown---make use only of a single output
format at a time.

As a secondary objective, I wanted to allow modifications of the standard
latex template to allow for things such as headers and footers and
author affiliations.

# rmdplugr

I did not, however, want to produce *yet another* custom latex template
needing to be continuously updated along with the default templates,
nor having to cater to different versions of pandoc, having
to keep separate templates for different versions (as rmarkdown does).

rmdplugr was created to avoid such issues and does so by instead
modifying the default latex template in a version-agnostic 
fashion. The default template is pulled by calling

```bash
pandoc -D latex
```

The template is then modified with modifications in the
form of *plugins*, which are merged into the latex template---sometimes
replacing other material, but usually inserting new material, such
as support for footers and headers.

In this way, rmdplugr doesn't have to adapt to the pandoc version and
can even be used with custom templates *provided* that some of the matter
from the default template is left intact.

These *plugins* can be turned on and off via the `output` setting in
the metadata block and their options are controlled by 
metadata settings.

# Plugins

## Marginal material

Headers and footers are provided using **fancyhdr** for standard latex 
document classes and **scrlayer-page** for KOMA-script classes.
Simply adding

```yaml
header: true
```

in the metadata block will invoke the default settings using the `automark`
option in **scrlayer-page** and the default `\pagestyle{fancy}` for **fancyhdr**.
More advanced settings can be provided by using

```yaml
header:
  l: Johan Larsson
  c: Document title
footer:
  r: Date
```
