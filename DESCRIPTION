Description: This package provides templates and wrappers built around the
    default Rmarkdown pdf templates from 'rmarkdown' and 'bookdown' and the
    latex template from 'pandoc'. The goal is to restore most of the
    style modifications introduced by these default templates, such as
    smaller margins, paragraph spacing, and compact titles, and also
    to enable affiliations through the latex 'auhthblk' package and
    marginal material using either 'scrlayer-page' or 'fancyhdr'.
